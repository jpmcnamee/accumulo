Upgrade Test Framework brief overview.

To run upgrade tests you only have to run ./upgrade_test.sh
for options run: ./upgrade_test.sh --help

The purpose of this script is to test upgrading from accumulo 1.5.* to 1.6.* (or 1.6.* to 1.7.*)
This script will unpack and set up an instance of hadoop and zookeeper as well as
the two accumulo files.
    (Currently only tested on Hadoop versions 2.2.0 and 1.2.1 and Zookeeper version 3.4.5)


This script expects to be given 4 tar files (hadoop zookeeper, old accumulo, new accumulo)
    ex) ./upgrade_test.sh -h hadoop-2.2.0.tar.gz -z zookeeper-3.4.5.tar.gz
         -o accumulo-1.5.1-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz -n accumulo-1.6.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz

*or

This script expects the HADOOP_PREFIX and ZOOKEEPER_HOME env variables to be set as well as the
2 tar files (for the old accumulo and new accumulo).
    ex) ./upgrade_test.sh -o accumulo-1.5.1-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz -n accumulo-1.6.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz


The tar files are extracted in a newly created tmp/ folder. You can change the name/location
of this folder by setting the -d flag.
    ex) ./upgrade_test.sh -d /path/to/your/tmpdir

Once all the files have been set up and configured hadoop and zookeeper are started,
then the tests are run, after the tests are run hadoop and zookeeper will be shut down.
    - Each test is run twice, once with a normal clean shutdown and once with a dirty
      shutdown.

* The tests are partially self verifying in that they rely on the java files to fail and throw an exeption
  if something goes wrong. If this occurs then the script will stop, shutdown hadoop, zookeeper, and accumulo
  as well as print a failure message to the consol. If all java files return normally the script assumes that
  everything went as planned and will print a success message to the consol.
    - The outpout of the tests will be directed to the tmp/testResults file
    - Any error messages from the tests will be directed to the tmp/errorTestResults
    - For full confidence you should manually check test results file and the error test results file

Since extracting and configuring hadoop zookeeper and accumulo can be time consuming
this script will attempt to skip those steps if it sees that hadoop zookeeper and
accumulo have already been extracted and configured in their correct places.
 (Usfull if you are running this script multiple times and only care about the
  tests and not the setup)

The script will automatically scan the upgrade/tests/ directory and automatically run any upgrade tests
(files ending in .sh) that it finds.
    - Each upgrade test is expected to have two phases, a pre-test and a post-test phase
    - The main upgrade_test.sh script will handle starting and stopping accumulo versions
